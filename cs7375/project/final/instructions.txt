python3.13 life_expectancy_app/app.py

OR

export FLASK_APP=life_expectancy_app/app.py
flask run

Interaction Flow
Browser requests / → Flask routes it to index() in in_and_out.py.

GET request → index.html is rendered with result=None.

User submits form → POST request with numbers + string.

in_and_out.py computes average, concatenates with string, sets result.

Template re-renders with result displayed.

This separation is the standard Flask pattern:

app.py = driver / app factory

in_and_out.py = business logic + routes

index.html = presentation
