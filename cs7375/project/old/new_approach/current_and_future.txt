Current: averaging predictions (due Sunday). simple statistical imputation. 
Will only use subset of geo data because of duplicates in state and county. 
Will use full demo data.
Future: Meta-Model (Ensemble Learning) with model-based learning, model_based imputation
Will at minimum add full geo data for at least 3 models. Will aim for 5 and a max of 7 models by searching for other datasets.

Flask code will need county-state pair data structure to validate
state-county pairs for validity.
Will also need to boundary check date of birth, race and sex.
